<h3>1.0 GENERAL INFORMATION</h3>
	<ul><p id="definition-terms">1.1 Definition of Terms</p>
		<li>A. Class - A class is your scheduled session with the student. All classes are
		conducted online via Skype. Each class session lasts 30 minutes and is divided into
		two parts -- class session and reporting. Class session is 25 minutes long and the
		remaining 5 minutes are used for reporting and preparing for your next class.</li>
		<li>B. Reports - Reports are records of information related to the most recent conducted
		class session. It is reported using a provided document which should be filled up
		after each class. It is also used as a reference for supervisors to determine whether
		the class was successfully conducted or not.</li>
		<li>C. History - A history is a report for a class that was recently conducted. It also
		serves as a reference for the tutor to determine what lesson is needed for the next
		class session or whether there is a need to review the previous lesson with the
		student.</li>
		<li>D. Schedule - This is represented through a calendar. An Open status means that the
		schedule is open for students to book. A Closed status means that the schedule is
		already taken and booked by a student. The tutor has to wait for the supervisor’s
		approval each time he opens a new class schedule.</li>
		<li>E. Material - Material refers to a lesson in PDF format. When the class is being
		conducted, the material serves as the reference for both the tutor and the student.
		The tutor sends the material or link of the lesson to the student via Skype.</li>
		<li>F. Conversion – A conversion simply means that a class session is successfully
		conducted. A single conversion means that the tutor is eligible to get paid for the
		conducted class. One conversion indicates one successful class session.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<ul>
		<p id="remember">1.2 Important Points to Remember</p>
		<li>A. Reporting - The tutor has to send a report at the end of each class. No report
		means no conversion and the tutor will not get paid. The system only allows the
		tutor to send the report within the 24 hour period which starts at the end of each
		class session.</li>
		<li>B. History - To continue a class, the tutor has to check the students’ history log
		before starting a new class session. This will allow the tutor to review the last
		lesson he conducted or of another tutor’s to accurately address the need of the
		student.</li>

		make the student feel comfortable with you as much as possible. Always keep
		your smile. A smile is the universal welcome.</li>

		starting at the level you’ve placed them at.</li>
